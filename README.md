# Intro-to-Game-AI-and-Reinforcement-Learning
These are my ipynb files for the Kaggle course "Intro to Game AI and Reinforcement Learning"

In this machine learning project from kaggle, we are required to make an agent that plays the game of ConnectX using reinforcement learning. The agent takes in various parametres such as the size of the board, the mark assigned to the agent, the current configuration of the board and returns a number of the column that it thinks is the best move for the game. Each agent is then evaluated by playing with other agents and then assigned a skill level.
